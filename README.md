### Based on Qgis.

1. [Mother Tree Selection & Data Processing Algorithm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SKJVaf4EQS6YIfgy6zvNKF3enyfhXGCz/view?usp=drivesdk) :
This algorithm tool follows primarily the Shelterwood silviculture system with high intensity logging, leaving only 15-30 mature mother trees per ha. and this tools only works on Qgis (version 3.6 or later). Those selected mature mother trees are well distributed for seed distribution and healthy among others stands.
2. [Stratified Systematic Sampling Plot Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHkQpPCXZoYNRKaIRCXzq72QceStQIdv/view?usp=drivesdk) :
You can easily create a systematic sampling design to be used in a forest inventory.

3. [Forest Fireline Tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SmBOCXUTwPjRdjUoZUdfDkaVPAMCyG-g/view?usp=drivesdk) :
You can easily design inner and outer forest fire line (i.e.: 1.5 m. & 5 m. width)
